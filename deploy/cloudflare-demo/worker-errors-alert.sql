-- Deploy demo_upstream_failed logging before applying this alert query.
-- Invocation summaries cannot distinguish intentional 503s from upstream 503s.
-- Unexpected upstream failures emit separate error logs, which remain included.
-- Cloudflare adaptive alert datasets do not support DISTINCT aggregates.
-- This value counts error records, not failed requests or affected visitors.
-- Unknown invocation types stay in this alert so schema gaps cannot hide errors.
-- Install worker-lifecycle-alert.sql as a second alert before applying this split.
