# systemd

The standalone binary (Linux 5.3+) can run as an unprivileged systemd service with delegated
CPU and memory controllers for native application limits.

## Install the unit

Use the reference
[`shinyhub.service`](https://github.com/rvben/shinyhub/blob/main/deploy/systemd/shinyhub.service)
as a starting point:

```bash
sudo install -m 0755 shinyhub /usr/local/bin/shinyhub
sudo install -m 0644 deploy/systemd/shinyhub.service /etc/systemd/system/shinyhub.service
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now shinyhub
```

Create the service user, configuration, and data directories referenced by the
unit before starting it. Store `auth.secret` outside the repository with owner-
only permissions.

## Reload the server

Set `server.pid_file: /run/shinyhub/shinyhub.pid`. The unit creates that runtime
directory with mode `0700`. Its `serve --supervise` parent stays systemd's direct
child across reloads and watches the active server with Linux pidfds.
`MainPID` remains the supervisor; the PID file names the active server.
Use `Type=notify`, `NotifyAccess=all`, `GuessMainPID=no`, and
`KillMode=control-group`, without a systemd `PIDFile=` directive.
An unexpected active-server exit makes the supervisor fail, allowing
`Restart=on-failure` to restart the unit even when older relays remain.
Its `ExecReload` calls `shinyhub reload --wait 10m`
and waits for the successor's readiness acknowledgement. `systemctl reload`
returns nonzero when the reload is refused, its transition wait expires, or the
successor fails to start; the current server keeps serving after a failed handoff.

For servers installed with a signal-based unit, follow the one-time transition
in [zero-downtime upgrades](../zero-downtime-upgrades.md) before replacing
`ExecReload`. Install the updated unit and run `systemctl daemon-reload`;
replacing the binary alone does not update systemd's reload command.

## Private service configuration

The unit is normally `0644`; keep secret values out of `Environment=` lines
and drop-ins. Use `auth.secret_file: /etc/shinyhub/auth.secret` in
`shinyhub.yaml` for the existing root secret. The secret file must be readable
by the service user and have mode `0600`; ShinyHub rejects group- or
world-readable files. Moving the existing value is not a rotation. Follow
[secret rotation](../secret-rotation.md) before replacing it, because it also
encrypts persistent app secrets.

Keep `shinyhub.yaml` owned by `shinyhub:shinyhub` with mode `0600` when it
contains proxy, OAuth, deploy, or database credentials. For settings supplied through environment variables, use a service-user-readable
owner-only `/etc/shinyhub/server.env` (0600) and set:

```yaml
server:
  env_file: /etc/shinyhub/server.env
```

ShinyHub reads this file at startup and again before launching each successor.
Use `KEY=value` lines; blank lines and full-line `#` comments are allowed.
Single quotes preserve literal text, double quotes accept escaped characters.
There is no shell expansion, `export`, or inline comment syntax. Duplicate or
unsupported keys, malformed quotes, non-regular files, and public permissions
refuse the reload before spawning a successor. Errors never print file values.

The file overrides inherited values for known `SHINYHUB_*` settings, proxy
variables (`HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY`, `ALL_PROXY`, `NO_PROXY` and their lowercase
forms), and `UV_*` settings. Removed keys are removed from the successor's
environment; an empty value also overrides an inherited value. `SHINYHUB_CONFIG`,
`SHINYHUB_PID_FILE`, and internal handoff/systemd variables cannot be changed by
this file. Keep `server.pid_file` stable across handoffs. Existing replicas keep
their launch environments; changed settings affect the new controller and future
builds/replicas. Root-secret rotation still requires the documented migration;
keep it in `auth.secret_file`, rather than this environment file.

A systemd `EnvironmentFile=` remains supported, but systemd does not re-read it
when ShinyHub forks a successor: changes there still require a restart. Moving
changing settings to `server.env_file` keeps them out of the unit and makes a
reload sufficient. For systemd-only settings, use a `[Service]` drop-in and
`systemctl daemon-reload`; clear `ExecReload=` before replacing its command.

Installing `--supervise` on an existing signal-based or unsupervised unit needs
one announced restart. Future handoffs retain this minimal supervisor. To verify,
compare `systemctl show -p MainPID shinyhub` (stable supervisor) with the PID file
(changing active server) and `shinyhub status --config /etc/shinyhub/shinyhub.yaml`.

Broker-native workers with journal output survive controller restarts when
`server.shutdown_apps: adopt`; see [native user isolation](../native-user-isolation.md).
Shared-user native replicas remain in this service's cgroup and are stopped by
`systemctl restart`. `Delegate=` allows resource management; it does not exempt
sub-cgroups from service termination. `KillMode=mixed` still sends the final
SIGKILL to the entire cgroup, so it is not a restart-survival setting.

The opt-in [per-app user backend](../native-user-isolation.md) adds a separate
root broker and dedicated app accounts. The following limitation applies when
`runtime.native.broker_socket` is empty.

These permissions protect against other local users, not native replicas
running as the same UID. Native apps can read other replicas' environments
and server-readable files. Use a separate runtime boundary for app code you
do not trust; see [native isolation](../isolation.md). The shipped hardening
and cgroup delegation are not per-app user isolation. Do not enable
`ProtectControlGroups` or `ProtectSystem=strict` blindly: the native runtime
needs delegated cgroups and writable app data.

## Reverse proxy

Keep the ShinyHub listener on loopback and terminate HTTPS with Caddy, nginx, or
another reverse proxy. Forward both `base_url` and `app_origin` hostnames when a
dedicated application origin is configured.

## Upgrades

The reference unit supports listener handoff on `SIGHUP`. Follow the
[zero-downtime upgrade guide](../zero-downtime-upgrades.md) to replace the
binary while existing HTTP and WebSocket connections drain normally.

The unit sets `RestartPreventExitStatus=7`. Exit `7` means the database was
migrated by a newer build, which this binary refuses to serve; retrying cannot
fix it, so systemd stops and the unit shows `failed` instead of looping in
`activating (auto-restart)`. If you copy the unit rather than installing it,
keep that line, or a botched downgrade looks healthy to monitoring while the
service is down. `journalctl -u shinyhub` shows the two versions involved.

Before applying pending migrations the server writes a pre-migration snapshot of
the SQLite database beside it; see
[Schema migrations on startup](../configuration.md#schema-migrations-on-startup).
Those files are pruned automatically down to a configurable retention count
(default 5), so include at most that many full-size database copies in
whatever disk-space policy covers `/var/lib/shinyhub`.
